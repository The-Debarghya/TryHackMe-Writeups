# Year Of The Rabbit

* IP = 10.10.83.188

## Questions/Tasks:

* Starting off with basic enumeration using *Nmap* to discover all open ports on the server:
`nmap -sC -sV -v $IP` (This scans with default scripts on top 1000 ports on the mentioned host and also determines the version of the services running on the open ports.)

* **Nmap Scan Results:**
```bash
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 3.0.2
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 6.7p1 Debian 5 (protocol 2.0)

* Since there is a website running, next we need to enumerate the website to find any other directories/files using *gobuster*:<br>
`gobuster -u "http://IP/" -w common.txt`

* **GoBuster Scan Results:**
```
/assets (Status: 301)
/index.html (Status: 200)

```
* Opening the webpage in the browser, we're brought here:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/1.png)
* Next we visit the `/assets` directory, which contains 2 files:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/2.png)
* We found some strange comments on the `/assets/style.css` page:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/3.png)
* Next we pulled down the above mentioned file, `sup3r_s3cr3t_fl4g.php` with *wget* command:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/4.png)
* Only thing worth looking into the file was this:
```HTML
<noscript>Love it when people block Javascript...<br></noscript>
<noscript>This is happening whether you like it or not... The hint is in the video. If you're stuck here then you're just going to have to bite the bullet!<br>Make sure your audio is turned up!<br></noscript>

```
* So as it says, we downloaded the `RickRoll.mp4` from /assets page, ran `binwalk` command on the file and got this output:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/6.png)
* After looking into each stuff and extracting all the files we found out that we are totally rickrolledü•≤!!
* Now looking carefully into the wget output above we see a query, `hidden_directory=/WExYY2Cv-qU`.
* Quickly we visited that directory and found only one file:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/5.png)
* Downloaded the image, it looked like this:( Go Away all you **Simps**!!)üòèüòè<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/Hot_Babe.png)
* Anyways, next enumeration on the image with simple `strings` command revealed this:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/7.png)<br>
* The username for FTP we found was `ftpuser` and there were several passwords to guess from, hence we copied all of them into a file `pass.txt` and bruteforced login with hydra:`hydra -L ftpuser -p pass.txt $IP ftp`

* Finally, hydra cracked the password to be:`5iez1wGXKfPKQ`.
* Logged into the FTP server, and found this file:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/8.png)
* The contents, looked something like the esoteric language, **Brainfuck**:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/9.png)
* Next we decoded the contents with some online <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/brainfuck-language">interpreter</a>, the results came out as:
```
User: eli
Password: DSpDiM1wAEwid
```
* This must be the ssh credentials, now ssh into the server as **eli** using the above password, we're greeted with this message:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/10.png)
* Find out the `s3cr3t` directory with the `find` command and see its contents( since it has read permissions for all):<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/11.png)

* Now, change user with `su gwendoline` using the password:`MniVCQVhQHUNI`; we get the user flag in gwendoline's home directory...


1. What is the user flag?

* Initial enumeration to escalate privileges with `sudo -l` gives this:<br>
![Screenshot](./assets/12.png)
* But unfortunately, we cannot run the command as root, as the permissions are given as `(ALL, !root): NOPASSWD`
* After sticking around here for a while, we found this article on <a href="https://resources.whitesourcesoftware.com/blog-whitesource/new-vulnerability-in-sudo-cve-2019-14287">CVE-2019-14287</a>, which says we can exploit any sudo version lesser than *1.8.28* using the `-u` flag set as `#-1`, which is a user that typically doesn't exist at all, but in turn we become root!!
* Now execute `sudo /usr/bin/vi /home/gwendoline/user.txt` adding `-u#-1`, we can open the `vi` text editor on the user.txt file.
* Finally, use <a href="https://gtfobins.github.io/">Gtfobins</a> to escape out of the text editor into a root shell:<br>

2. What is the root flag?
